# Leves to NPC

Leves are linked to an NPC via the levels_csv, this is also the same for the starting position of the Leve.


## Example: 
- Leve ID: `906` (Necrologos: His Treasure Forhelen (L))
- NPC ID: `1011208` (Eloin)

npc: `1011208` in levels = id: `5581915`

Then find 5581915 in leves CSV.

- Start npc: Offset `8`
- Start Position: Offset `9`
